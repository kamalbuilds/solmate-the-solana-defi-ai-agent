- Automatically executing transactions when needed
- Providing real-time updates and progress tracking
- Maintaining portfolio balance according to user preferences

## üåü Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Interface
- Express portfolio goals in plain English
- No need to understand complex DeFi terminology
- AI translates intentions into actions

### 2. Autonomous Execution
- Breaks down complex goals into steps
- Executes transactions automatically
- Handles error recovery
- Provides progress updates

### 3. Portfolio Management
- Multi-protocol position monitoring
- Yield optimization

## üîó AVS & Subgraph Integration

### Eigenlayer AVS Integration

The portfolio manager integrates with Eigenlayer's Actively Validated Service (AVS) to provide decentralized portfolio validation:

#### Components:

1. **PortfolioValidationServiceManager**
   - Manages portfolio validation tasks
   - Handles operator registrations and responses
   - Validates operator signatures
   - Maintains token registry and eligibility data

2. **PortfolioTask**
   - Defines portfolio validation task structure
   - Tracks task status and responses
   - Supports multiple validation strategies:
     - TokenEligibility
     - PortfolioBalance
     - RiskAssessment

#### Deployment & Setup:

- **PortfolioDeployer**
  - Deploys and initializes AVS contracts
  - Sets up stake registry
  - Configures operator quorum
  - Manages token strategy deployment

- **Deployment Library**
  - Handles proxy deployment
  - Manages contract upgrades
  - Stores deployment configurations

### Subgraph Integration

The subgraph indexes and tracks portfolio validation events and data:

#### Schema:

```graphql
type Portfolio @entity {
  id: Bytes!
  taskId: BigInt!
  tokens: [Token!]!
  amounts: [BigInt!]!
  strategy: String!
  validationType: Int!
  status: Int!
  createdAt: BigInt!
  validations: [Validation!]!
}

type Token @entity {
  id: Bytes!
  chain: String!
  address: Bytes!
  isEligible: Boolean!
  metadata: String
  createdBlock: BigInt!
  portfolios: [Portfolio!]!
}

type Validation @entity {
  id: Bytes!
  portfolio: Portfolio!
  operator: Bytes!
  validation: Bytes!
  timestamp: BigInt!
}
```

#### Event Handlers:

- **NewPortfolioTask**: Indexes new portfolio validation requests
- **ValidationSubmitted**: Tracks operator validations
- **TokenDataUpdated**: Monitors token eligibility updates

### Integration Flow

1. **Portfolio Creation**
   - User submits portfolio through SolMate
   - AVS creates validation task
   - Event emitted and indexed by subgraph

2. **Validation Process**
   - Operators submit validations
   - AVS verifies signatures
   - Subgraph indexes validation responses

3. **Data Analysis**
   - SolMate queries subgraph for validation data
   - AI analyzes validation responses
   - Generates recommendations based on consensus

4. **Token Management**
   - AVS maintains token registry
   - Updates token eligibility
   - Subgraph provides token analytics

### Benefits

- **Decentralized Validation**: Multiple operators validate portfolio decisions
- **Transparent History**: All validations and updates are publicly trackable
- **Real-time Analytics**: Quick access to historical validation data
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles multiple portfolios and validation strategies
- **Secure Operations**: Cryptographic verification of operator responses
